Accurate Body Fat Prediction Using Machine Learning

Body fat percentage is closely linked to various health conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Predicting body fat percentage helps in assessing an individual's risk for these health issues.
We are proposing a solution by creating a model using Random Forest regressor. Random Forest has ability to handle high-dimensional datasets and automatically select the most relevant features. This eliminates the need for manual feature selection and reduces the risk of overfitting.  We are removing the outliers using IQR then we are scaling the data using standard scaler.
